									<h1>About Me</h1>

								<!-- Text -->
									<!--
									<p>
										I am a 20 year old computer science student in my second year at the University of York.
										 Outside of my degree I keep my skills sharp by working on various projects in a variety
										  of fields, learning general overviews of more advanced techniques online and taking on
										   the occasional daily coding problem if I have spare time. Outside of that, I enjoy 
										   playing video games, hanging out with my friends, cooking or practising magic tricks. 
									</p>
									-->

									<p>
										I am a 22 year old computer scientist with a Bachelor of Science from the University of York, where
										I completed a year of work as a Research Software Engineer Intern. I have experience with 
										High-Performance Computing (especially with EasyBuild and Slurm), with Data Science and Software
										Engineering.

										I am experienced in a multitude of programming languages, namely Python, C, Julia and Java.
										I enjoy taking on challenges and learning new skills.

										Outside of work, I enjoy volunteering, cooking & Editing.

										<h1>
										Why "CitricAmoeba" ?	
										</h1>
										As you may have noticed, I use "CitricAmoeba" a lot, both as part of this page's URL,
										 and as part of my Discord Bot's name, not to mention numerous other instances not shown.
										This was a randomly generated name I received when I was younger and I stuck with it,
										 eventually using it as my Github username, hence due to the way Github pages works I 
										 have to include it in the URL. While I could create a new Github account using my actual
										  name, I believe that showing all of my work in the same place rather than across two accounts
										   was a better approach, and better demonstrates who I am as a person.
